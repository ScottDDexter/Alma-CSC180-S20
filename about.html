<h3>What is this course about?</h3>

  <p>The title doesn't give too much of a clue, does it? Now that we're all staying at home, I'm glad that the title is pretty general, because I've had to change my mind about the purpose/focus of this course a few times. But at least for now, I think this course will be maximally meaningful if it's connected somehow to the pandemic, so I'm thinking about the course as a way to explore three layered questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>      what does it mean to study disability?
<li>      what role does technology play in the lives of people with disabilities?
<li>      how is COVID-19 changing the ways we answer (at least) question 2?
</ol>

  <p>And we have an opportunity to make a difference, too--I'm sure we'll find several ways in which technology in this age of COVID-19 is not serving people with disabilities well. We might not have the collective skills to solve these problems in a month, but can we do something to raise awareness and, perhaps, generate some energy toward solving problems?</p>

  <h3>
    "think critically, serve generously, lead purposefully and live responsibly"
  </h3>

  <p>Yup: that old thing. Whenever I start teaching a new course, I do find it helpful to think about how it can be connected to the College's mission and values. In addition to this key phrase from the mission statement, I think this course also has something to do with these elements of the College value statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>      Students actively participate in learning through research-based undergraduate scholarship and experiential, international, and service learning opportunities.
<li>      apply intellectual rigor in exploring a range of disciplines... the depth of understanding to excel in oneâ€™s discipline and to perceive the connections among disciplines.
</ul>

  <p>In particular, I hope you'll experience in this course:</p>
<ul>
      <li>
        we're using ideas from multiple disciplines to understand our "root question:" How is COVID-19 changing the role technology plays in the lives of people with disabilities?
      </li>
      <li>
        the professor doesn't have all the answers! This is an open-ended, research-based course: I'm setting up a framework for us to work together to develop an understanding of this question, but I don't know where we're going to end up.
      </li>
      <li>
        reading and writing are important modes of communication, but we're not limited to them (and, we need to understand when our communication isn't accessible to everyone, and how to move closer to that goal).
      </li>
</ul>
  <h3>
    An Important Proviso
  </h3>

  <p>
    I want to be very clear that I do not identify as a person with a disability. As I mention in my video introduction, I was pushed to start thinking about disability and computer science by a student several years ago. I also have some family experience with disability: my mom is a polio survivor who sustained muscle damage in one of her legs, so has always had a sort of cap on her mobility. But I most definitely do not speak as, nor could I possibly speak for, anyone who does identify as having a disability. I'll be doing my best to bring those voices into our "classroom," and I hope you'll join me in that.
  </p>

  <h3>
    On Grades and Grading
  </h3>

  <p>
    My general feeling is that Spring Term courses are primarily about an immersive learning experience, somewhat less about your demonstrating mastery of some area of knowledge. And, to be very honest, I'd much rather spend my energy creating that experience with you than closely grading papers and projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, my initial plan is to grade by engagement. This is something more than "participation"--to me, participation includes things like like showing up to class and doing just exactly what the professor says to do. I don't think that's good enough for a Spring Term class--if you were traveling now (and I know several of you wish you were!), you simply wouldn't be able to simply "participate." So what I'm looking for, in terms of A-level performance, is for you to bring your best self--your best mind, your best curiosity, your best sense of humor, your sharpest questioning--to this class. Take your time with the things I ask you to read/watch/listen to. Respond thoughtfully and honestly. When we meet together, don't only bring questions and comments, but treat the rest of us with care and kindness and generosity. Do the work.
  </p>

  <p>
    To be precise, here are the things I'm looking for that constitute engagement:
  </p>
<ul>
      <li>timely responses to assigned reading/viewing/listing, responding to the posed questions</li>
      <li>timely production of "work products"</li>
      <li>joining our synchronous meetings</li>
      <li>thoughtful and considerate contributions to discussions, whether synchronous or asynchronous, by speaking and/or writing</li>
      <li>contributing fully to the work of your team(s)--I'll be asking you at the end of the semester to evaluate your teammates' engagement</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    If something comes up for you that will reduce your ability to do any of this, even for a day, please let me right away.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm sure everyone is more than capable of earning an A in this class, and I expect everyone will. If I feel like your presence is wandering in a way that puts that A in jeopardy, I'll let you know quickly so we can work out what to do.
