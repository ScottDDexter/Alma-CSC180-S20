      <h1>Final Project Materials and Activities</h>
<h2>Milestones</h2>
<p>These are subject to fine-tuning as the term progresses, but here's how I think the projects should progress. Depending on how things go, I may add a milestone or two if I think it would help you. I will probably also do quick check-ins with teams at points in between....<br></p>
<p><strong>May 7 (Thursday).</strong> Formal project statement.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the essential message/focus of the project?</li>
  <li>Who is the primary intended audience? Are there other audiences?</li>
  <li>What form will the project take? In what medium/media will it be delivered?</li>
  <li>What research have you done? What research remains to be done?<br></li>
  <li>What's your work plan? Who will be doing what, when?<br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>May 13 (Wednesday). </strong>First draft due (just to the professor)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide an updated statement of your message/focus and audience. Also, how will you <i>reach</i> your intended audience?<br></li>
  <li>Provide at least some materials produced in your chosen medium, though they don't need to be polished.</li>
  <li>Provide a detailed outline of what work remains to be done.</li>
  <li>I will meet with teams during class on Friday the 15th.<br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>May 19 (Tuesday).</strong> Final draft presentations.</p>
<p>Share your project with the class by 9am on Friday; review other teams' projects before class. <br></p>
<p><strong>May 21 (Thursday).</strong> Final project due at class time.</p>

<h2>Final Project Peer Review</h2>

<p>Review the projects from the other two teams, and post your reviews in the appropriate forum. Below I list some particular focus areas you should address; give a response to each area (a couple sentences or more). Remember that your primary goal here is to help these projects be as good as possible when they are released to the public, so point out issues you see&mdash;but of course be kind!<br></p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The content should be accurate and well-researched. Viewers should know how to find out more.</p>
<p>The content should be clearly written (for text) and easy to read/view/consume.</p>
<p>The content should be 'pitched' appropriately for the intended audience.</p>
<h3>Structure and Appearance</h3>
<p>The purpose of the project, or its essential message, should be obvious.</p>
<p>The project materials should be well-organized; it should be easy for the 'reader' to perceive the 'flow'.</p>
<p>The visual appearance/layout of the project should be appealing and support the structure (rather than making it confusing).</p>
<p>The project materials should have some complexity; it should be clear what the contribution of the project is, and it should be clear that significant work was invested to shape the final product.<br></p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>The project materials should of course be accessible.<br></p>

<h3>Other Suggestions</h3><p>Anything else you see that would improve this work?</p>

<h2>Final Project Submission</h2>

<p>Submit here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your project, in whatever form it takes</li>
  <li>A summary description of your project, including:

<ul>
  <li>What is the goal of the project? (Some projects may have this kind of statement "embedded" in them already, but please put it in this document as well.</li>
  <li>Who is your audience? How will/would you make sure your audience actually sees your work?</li>
  <li>A detailed work allocation, describing who did what on the project.</li>
  <li>Individual reflections on what (if anything) you learned in the course of this project and/or what other parts of the course this reinforced (or contradicted!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
