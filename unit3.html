      <h2>Unit 3: [Digital] Accessibility</h2>
<h3>How can we make digital technologies (hardware, software, websites) accessible and usable by all people? What obstacles exist? How can they be overcome?</h3>

<p>By now, we've talked a fair amount about a range of technologies and disability (though there are also huge swaths of technology we haven't looked at closely). We've also touched on the issue of accessibility--Emily Atkinson's talk and Josh Miele's various materials, most notably. In this unit, we'll focus more closely on the issues around access to "digital" technology&mdash;software, the web, and the devices through which we interact with them. </p>

<h4>For <em>Day 8</em> [Wednesday, May 6]</h4>

<p>Here are a few "introductions"
  to (web) accessibility from various perspectives. Read these with a critical
  eye--what can you tell about the author? How does their language align
  with, or diverge from, what we've been hearing about in the earlier
  units? (Would Josh, or the people of Kinetic Light, agree with the way
  these pieces describe accessibility?)</p>

  <p>Also, think about how these pieces categorize disability--or even how they regard disability and disabled people in general. What differences do you see between the perspectives from units 1-2 and these?</p><p>Finally, look at what these pieces say about digital communication (much of what they say can be generalized beyond the web)? When you start thinking about communication from an accessibility perspective, what kinds of things must you keep in mind?<br></p>

We may be following some of the links later on (including how to use a screenreader), but for today just read the text on the page.</p>

<h5>Free Write</h5>

<p>Each of the readings was from someone or some group that cares about digital accessibility&mdash;these are people that may or may not be disabled, may or may not have a good sense of history, and so on.  What <i>new</i> or <i>different</i> perspectives on <i>disability </i>did you find in the readings? Are these more or less <i>compatible</i> with what we've seen so far, or do you see any <i>contradictions</i> or <i>conflicts</i>? Give a couple specific examples of compatible or contradictory perspectives.<br></p>
